# @hex-core/components

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6c8c141: Theme A — WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance.

  Major bump on `@hex-core/components` and `@hex-core/tokens` — there are user-observable behavior and visual changes (see Migration). Everything else is additive or covered by the audit gate.

  ### Migration
  - **Dark `--destructive` lightened, `--destructive-foreground` flipped to dark** across all three theme presets (default / midnight / ember). Required so destructive surfaces and destructive text both pass WCAG 2.2 AA in dark mode. Visual diff: previously a deep red (`hsl(0 62% 30%)`) with white text, now a coral red (`hsl(0 75% 65%)`) with dark text (`hsl(0 75% 15%)`). Consumers who painted `--destructive-foreground` on a _non-destructive_ surface in dark mode (uncommon — most use it inside destructive buttons / alerts) will see dark text instead of white and need to point those surfaces at `--foreground` instead.
  - **`ScrollArea` viewport is now keyboard-focusable by default** (`viewportTabIndex={0}`). Apps that wrap purely decorative content in ScrollArea will see a new tab stop. Pass `viewportTabIndex={-1}` to opt out — the prop is the new opt-out surface and is documented in `scroll-area.schema.ts`.
  - **`CommandSeparator` is no longer the cmdk primitive.** It now renders as `<div role="none" data-cmdk-separator="">` so it can sit inside `CommandList` (`role="listbox"`) without violating ARIA's required-children rule. The `data-cmdk-separator` attribute is preserved for selector compatibility, but anyone reading cmdk's _internal_ Separator state (rare) will need to update.
  - **`DataTable` accessible label prop renamed `ariaLabel` → `aria-label`** (kebab-case quoted prop) to match the convention used elsewhere in Hex UI. This was introduced earlier in the same PR cycle and never shipped publicly, but call it out for anyone tracking pre-release branches.
  - **`Dialog` overflow handling now uses an inner scroll container** (`scrollable={true}` is the default). Long content scrolls inside the focus trap; the close button stays anchored to the (non-scrolling) outer panel. Consumers who previously relied on DialogContent itself being the scroll container (custom `overflow-*` className overrides) should pass `scrollable={false}` and manage scroll themselves — `CommandDialog` does this internally.

  ### Additive changes

  `@hex-core/components`
  - `Combobox`: new `aria-labelledby` prop. Trigger now wires `aria-controls` to a `useId`-stable id pointing at `CommandList`, gated on `open` so it's only set when the listbox is actually mounted.
  - `DataTable`: new `caption?: ReactNode` and `aria-label?: string` props. Previously the table shipped without a caption, leaving screen-reader users without context.
  - `DialogContent`: new `scrollable?: boolean` prop (default `true`). See Migration.
  - `Slider`: new `thumbLabels?: string[]` prop for per-thumb names. Single-thumb sliders auto-mirror the Root's `aria-label`; range sliders fall back to indexed `(N of M)` names if no `thumbLabels` is provided. A dev-mode warning fires when `thumbLabels.length !== value.length`.
  - `ScrollArea`: new `viewportTabIndex?: number` prop. See Migration.
  - `CommandSeparator`: rendered as a presentational div. See Migration.
  - `TableCaption`: now sets `caption-bottom` so the `<caption>` element sits below the table visually while remaining first in document order (announced first by screen readers).

  `@hex-core/tokens`
  - Light `--muted-foreground` tightened to ≥4.5:1 across all three themes.
  - Light `--destructive` darkened so destructive button text passes 4.5:1.
  - Dark destructive flip — see Migration.

  ### Repo
  - New `pnpm run a11y-audit` boots the docs prod build and runs axe-core (`@axe-core/playwright`) against every component demo in light + dark. Fails on critical/serious violations. Wired into CI; report uploaded as a workflow artifact. Hardened against banner-string drift, port collisions, and SIGTERM cancellation.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains an Accessibility section covering form-control labelling, contrast budget, composite-widget rules, and dialog overflow guidance.

### Patch Changes

- c8a4d52: Fix: published tarballs now correctly pin workspace dependencies.

  Previous releases of `@hex-core/components`, `@hex-core/cli`, and `@hex-core/mcp` shipped `"@hex-core/registry": "workspace:^"` literal in the tarball's `dependencies`, breaking every consumer outside a pnpm workspace with `npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`. `@hex-core/tokens` shipped a similar literal for its registry dependency.

  Root cause: `scripts/publish-local.sh` used `npm publish`, which uploads tarballs as-is. Switched to `pnpm publish`, which rewrites `workspace:^` → pinned `^X.Y.Z` automatically.

  `@hex-core/registry` has no workspace dependencies and was not affected, but is bumped to keep the family in lockstep and simplify the release narrative.

  After this release, `npm install @hex-core/components` (and the other published packages) succeeds in any consumer project regardless of package manager.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 07bea53: Theme B substrate — full custom-tokens surface across the OS.

  **`@hex-core/tokens`** now ships beyond color + radius:
  - Spacing scale (`--space-1` through `--space-16`)
  - Gap presets (`--gap-sm/md/lg`)
  - Control heights (`--control-height-sm/md/lg`)
  - Typography scale (`--text-xs` through `--text-3xl`)
  - Motion duration tokens (`--duration-fast/normal/slow`)

  Shared across the 3 theme presets via `themes/shared.ts`. `themeToTailwindConfig`
  now emits `spacing`, `fontSize`, `transitionDuration`, and `height` maps in
  addition to `colors` and `borderRadius`, so consumers wire the whole token set
  into Tailwind's `theme.extend` in one call.

  **`@hex-core/components`** — all 47 components migrated to read tokens via
  CSS-variable references. Fallbacks match prior Tailwind defaults, so consumers
  without a theme loaded see zero visual change. Override `--space-6` (etc.) in
  your `globals.css` and every component reflows.

  **`@hex-core/registry`** — adds `tokenSetSchema`, `strictTokenSetSchema`,
  `strictThemeSchema`, plus `REQUIRED_COLOR_TOKENS` and `REQUIRED_RADIUS_TOKENS`
  constants. Strict variants validate that a theme defines the 19 color tokens +
  radius needed for components to render correctly. Existing `themeSchema` stays
  loose for runtime parsing.

  **`@hex-core/cli`** — adds `hex theme init` and `hex theme edit`:

  ```bash
  # scaffold globals.css from a preset (full token block, light + dark)
  pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli theme init --name midnight --out app/globals.css

  # override one or more tokens, scoped or both
  pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli theme edit \
    --file app/globals.css \
    --token "primary=240 50% 50%"
  ```

  114 unit tests cover the new surface (was 65 before).
