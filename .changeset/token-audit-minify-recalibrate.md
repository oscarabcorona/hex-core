Token-cost audit + calibration across every LLM-bound surface.

**`@hex-core/payload`** — Bundled registry now resolves the page-recipe build path correctly: `scripts/build-registry.ts` branches on `recipe.kind` so the build no longer fails on `kind: "page"` recipes. The bundled `registry/items/` grew from 132 to 183 entries (51 blocks + AI elements + motion primitives that were previously stranded by the build).

**`@hex-core/components` / `@hex-core/motion`** — Every component's `ai.tokenBudget` is now calibrated against the measured wire-shape (pretty-printed) `get_component_schema` token count — the shape MCP clients actually receive and rank by. Most primitives were under-declaring by 2–3× (`button` was 500 → 1,718; `cluster` was 250 → 938). Declared vs. measured is now within ±1 token across all 183 items. Wire output is unchanged; only the declared estimates were wrong.

**`@hex-core/mcp`** — Added a contract-test regression gate: `get_component` ≤ 15K tokens, `get_component_schema` ≤ 2.5K, `emit_app_context` (N=20) ≤ 5K. Wire output remains pretty-printed (human-readable for debugging); ceilings reflect the actual response shape with ~20% headroom over current max.

New maintenance script at `scripts/audit-tokens.ts` (`pnpm audit:tokens`) measures every LLM-bound surface — MCP tool responses, recipes, skills, the bundled registry — and writes `packages/mcp-server/TOKEN_AUDIT.md`. Pass `--update-budgets` to push measured numbers back into each schema's `ai.tokenBudget` literal. The audit asserts the bundled `@hex-core/payload` registry stays in sync with the repo-root `registry/` and bails loud if they drift.

Realistic compound load (4 SKILL.md packs + `emit_app_context` at N=20 + 1 page-recipe) is ~10K tokens — 5% of Claude's 200K window. There is no context-window pressure; this PR ships measurement, calibration, and a regression gate so future surface additions don't silently bloat MCP responses.
